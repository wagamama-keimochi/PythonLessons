# Even More With Lists-- Trying List Comprehension
In this lab you will write a Python program that does a little more advanced list manipulation.
This exercise is intended to get you introduced to some of the more powerful ways to work with lists.

# Requirements
Your software file will begin several lists imported from a module "lists". You will need to use list comprehension and list pairing to iterate and edit the data in the lists. There are three different tasks to perform and here are the requirements for each

Using the provided list 'school_lunches' from the lists module, your code shall use list comprehension to print out the daily menu, but substitute "bratwurst" everywhere you see "hot dog". Your code shall print the list directly so the output will include the brackets and quotations (['item 1', item 2' ... and so on])

Using the provided lists, 'questions" and "answers' from the lists module, your code shall use list pairing (zip) to iterate over the two lists at the same time. Your code shall print out questions and answers in a loop. Format them: "What is your [question]? My [question] is [answer]."

Using the provided list 'sports_teams' your code shall manipulate the nested lists to print all teams from New York and then all teams from Los Angeles. Just print the lists directly so the output will include the brackets and quotations (['team 1', team 2' ... and so on])
